The history of an empire is long and complex, spanning from ancient times through modern times. The key events in the history of an empire
    include:

1. **Birth and Rise**: An empire is formed when two or more nations or groups come together to form a single body capable of governance and
    sharing of resources.
2. **Expansion**: This involves bringing people, goods, knowledge, technology, ideas, and culture together for better living conditions and
    greater economic growth.
3. **War**: Wars between these nations cause harm to the people, economy, environment, and territorial rights.
4. **Cultural Exchange**: During wars or conflicts, there may be some cultural exchange that brings diverse perspectives and ideas across borders.
5. **Reunification**: When two or more empires come together for a unified governance with common language, laws, and customs, the empire is
    called an Empire of Nations.

It's also important to note that not all empires were equally successful. Some failed due to corruption, power struggle, internal conflict,
    external forces like invasions or wars etc. But overall, the key events in the history of an empire are based on the birth and rise of two or more
    nations into one unified entity for better living conditions and economic growth.
